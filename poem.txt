You start with git init
You'll use git throughout
You make a change, commit,
Stash if ever you're in doubt...

You use git status 
to view your working tree, 
you use git status - see 
changes untracked, staged for free.

you do a push to `origin`
and it gets saved on the Cloud
that's what git's all about

You use git status next, to view your working tree: all of your unsaved stuff,
push me, and then commit me, until I get my, github actions
